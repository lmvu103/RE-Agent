## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- fastmcp >= 3.0.0
- pyrestoolbox >= 3.0.4
- pydantic >= 2.0.0
- numpy >= 1.24.0
- pandas >= 2.0.0

## Known Limitations

1. Some pyrestoolbox upstream functions have known bugs - workarounds implemented in `gas_fixes.py`
2. Test coverage is functional (smoke tests) rather than exhaustive parametric testing
3. Geomechanics tools use simplified analytical models, not full numerical solutions
