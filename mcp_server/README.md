## What is This?

This MCP server bridges the gap between AI assistants and petroleum engineering workflows. Instead of manually calculating reservoir properties or writing complex scripts, you can simply ask Claude:

> *"Calculate the bubble point pressure for API 35° oil at 180°F with solution GOR of 800 scf/stb and gas gravity 0.75 using the Valko-McCain correlation"*

> *"Generate an IPR curve for my well with Pi=4000 psia, Pb=3500 psia, API 38°, 175°F, pay thickness 75 ft, permeability 150 mD"*

> *"Create a black oil table for simulation with pressures from 500 to 5000 psia"*

Claude will execute the calculations using industry-standard correlations and return accurate, formatted results.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ (UV package manager recommended but optional)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gabrielserrao/pyrestoolbox-mcp.git
cd pyrestoolbox-mcp

# 2. Install UV (optional but 10-100x faster than pip)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 3. Setup and test
make uv-install    # Creates venv and installs dependencies
make uv-test       # Verifies all 108 tools work correctly
```

### Connect to Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**IMPORTANT:** Use absolute paths for both `uv` and the project directory. GUI applications like Claude Desktop don't inherit your terminal's PATH.

**Find your UV path:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
which uv

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Command uv | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyrestoolbox": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/pyrestoolbox-mcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Common UV paths:**
- **macOS/Linux:** `/Users/username/.local/bin/uv` or `/home/username/.local/bin/uv`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\username\.cargo\bin\uv.exe`

**Example (macOS):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyrestoolbox": {
      "command": "/Users/john/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/Users/john/projects/pyrestoolbox-mcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (Linux):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyrestoolbox": {
      "command": "/home/john/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/home/john/projects/pyrestoolbox-mcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyrestoolbox": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\john\\.cargo\\bin\\uv.exe",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\john\\projects\\pyrestoolbox-mcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Add the AI Skill (Recommended)

The `SKILL/` folder in this repository contains a pre-built skill that teaches your AI assistant exactly how to use all 108 tools — correct parameter names, valid method codes, validation constraints, and multi-step workflows.

**What's included:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL/pyrestoolbox-mcp.skill` | Ready-to-install skill bundle (zip format) |
| `SKILL/SKILL.md` | Skill definition with YAML front-matter trigger conditions |
| `SKILL/tools-reference.md` | Complete parameter reference for all 108 tools |

**Installation (Claude Code):**

Copy the skill file to your Claude skills directory:

```bash
cp SKILL/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/pyrestoolbox-mcp.md

# Optional but recommended — full parameter reference
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/references
cp SKILL/tools-reference.md ~/.claude/skills/references/tools-reference.md
```

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you ask about reservoir engineering calculations, PVT analysis, well performance, geomechanics, or any pyResToolbox topic.

**What the skill teaches the AI:**
- Exact parameter names (`psd` not `pwf`, `sg` not `sg_g` for gas tools, `zmethod` vs `method`)
- All valid enum strings (`"VALMC"`, `"DAK"`, `"SWOF"`, `"COR"`, etc.)
- Required vs optional parameters for every tool
- Numeric validation constraints (API 0–100, gas SG 0.5–2.0, Poisson's ratio 0–0.5)
- Common multi-step workflows (PVT analysis, well performance, simulation input, geomechanics drilling window)

---

### Your First Query

Open Claude Desktop and try:

> "What's the bubble point pressure for a 35° API oil at 180°F with 800 scf/stb solution GOR and 0.75 gas gravity?"

Claude will use the `oil_bubble_point` tool and return results like:

```
Bubble Point Pressure: 3,456.7 psia
Method: Valko-McCain (VALMC)
Inputs: API=35°, T=180°F, Rs=800 scf/stb, SG_gas=0.75
```

## Unit System

All calculations default to **Field Units (US Oilfield)** per industry standard. Set `metric: true` on any tool to use **Metric Units** (Eclipse METRIC conventions: barsa, °C, metres, sm³/d) with no manual conversion needed. ECLIPSE keyword output automatically switches to METRIC headers.

| Property | Unit | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Pressure | psia | 3000 psia |
| Temperature | °F | 180°F |
| Permeability | mD | 100 mD |
| Pay Thickness | ft | 50 ft |
| Viscosity | cP | 0.85 cP |
| Oil Rate | STB/day | 542 STB/day |
| Gas Rate | MSCF/day | 1250 MSCF/day |
| Oil Gravity | API° or SG | 35° API |
| Gas Gravity | SG (air=1) | 0.75 |
| Solution GOR | scf/stb | 800 scf/stb |
| Oil FVF | rb/stb | 1.25 rb/stb |
| Gas FVF | rcf/scf | 0.0045 rcf/scf |
| Compressibility | 1/psi | 1.2×10⁻⁵ 1/psi |
| Density | lb/ft³ | 42.5 lb/ft³ |

## Programmatic Usage

While this server is designed for Claude Desktop integration, you can also use it programmatically:

### Python Client

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp.client import InMemoryTransport
from pyrestoolbox_mcp import mcp

async def calculate_pvt():
    transport = InMemoryTransport(mcp)

    async with transport.get_client() as client:
        # Calculate bubble point
        pb_result = await client.call_tool(
            "oil_bubble_point",
            {
                "api": 35.0,
                "degf": 180.0,
                "rsb": 800.0,
                "sg_g": 0.75,
                "method": "VALMC"
            }
        )
        pb = pb_result['value']
        print(f"Bubble Point: {pb:.2f} psia")

        # Calculate Rs at multiple pressures
        rs_result = await client.call_tool(
            "oil_solution_gor",
            {
                "api": 35.0,
                "degf": 180.0,
                "p": [1000, 2000, 3000, pb, 4000],
                "sg_g": 0.75,
                "pb": pb,
                "rsb": 800.0,
                "method": "VELAR"
            }
        )
        print(f"Rs values: {rs_result['value']}")

        # Access configuration resources
        methods = await client.read_resource("config://methods")
        print(f"Available methods:\n{methods.content}")

asyncio.run(calculate_pvt())
```

### HTTP/SSE Transport

```bash
# Start HTTP server
uv run fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000

# Or using Docker
docker-compose --profile http up -d
```

Then connect using any MCP client or HTTP client supporting the MCP protocol.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"uv: command not found"**
- Close and reopen terminal after installing UV
- Verify: `uv --version`
- Alternative: Use pip instead (`pip install -e .`)

**"make: command not found" (Windows)**
- Use manual commands from Makefile
- Or install Make for Windows via Chocolatey: `choco install make`

**UV sync fails**
- Clear cache: `rm -rf .venv && make uv-install`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.10+)

### Claude Desktop Integration

**Error: "spawn uv ENOENT"**
- This means Claude Desktop cannot find the `uv` command
- GUI applications don't inherit your terminal's PATH
- **Solution:** Use absolute path to `uv` in your config
- Find UV path: `which uv` (macOS/Linux) or `Get-Command uv` (Windows)
- Common locations:
  - macOS/Linux: `/Users/username/.local/bin/uv` or `/home/username/.local/bin/uv`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\username\.cargo\bin\uv.exe`

**Claude doesn't see the tools**
1. Use **absolute paths** for both `uv` command and project directory (no `~`, use full path)
2. Verify paths are correct: `ls /path/to/uv` and `ls /path/to/pyrestoolbox-mcp`
3. Completely restart Claude Desktop (Quit, not just close window)
4. Check Claude Desktop logs:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/logs/`
5. Test server manually: `cd /path/to/pyrestoolbox-mcp && make uv-server`

**Tools fail with errors**
- Verify all inputs use Field Units (psia, °F, ft, mD)
- Check parameter names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Run validation: `uv run python test_tools.py`

### Runtime Issues

**Import errors**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
make uv-install
# or
uv sync --force
```

**Calculation errors**
- Check units (must be psia, °F, etc.)
- Verify inputs are realistic (e.g., API 10-50, temperatures 60-300°F)
- Some correlations have valid ranges - try different methods
- Check [pyResToolbox docs](https://github.com/mwburgoyne/pyResToolbox) for correlation limits

**Performance issues**
- Array calculations are optimized via numpy
- For large datasets, consider batching requests
- Docker deployment adds minimal overhead
