## Tips

1. **Be specific** - include API gravity, temperature, pressure, and other relevant parameters
2. **Specify methods** - mention which correlation you want (VALMC, DAK, Corey, LET, etc.)
3. **Include units** - always specify units (psia, degF, mD, ft)
4. **Ask for comparisons** - Claude can compare methods and scenarios side by side
5. **Request tables** - ask for tabulated results when you need multiple values
6. **Chain queries** - build on previous answers for complex workflows
